Note that the Python program can always use a socket's getsockname() method to retrieve the current IP and port to which the socket is bound.

Warning: As documented here: http://bugs.python.org/issue1049

The behavior and return value for calling socket.socket.getsockname() on 
an unconnected unbound socket is unspecified. On UNIX, it returns an 
address ('0.0.0.0', 0), while on Windows it raises an obscure exception 
"error: (10022, 'Invalid argument')".

The first code listing:

>>> import socket
>>> s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
>>> s.sendto('Fake reply', ('127.0.0.1', 47873))

The indentation for the second line appears wrong. It looks like there is whitespace before the "s =", when there shouldn't be.

script dns_mx.py resolves the hostname of all the mx records to the same IP address.
In resolve_hostname "name = sys.argv[1]"should be changed to "name = hostname"
